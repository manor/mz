mz
==

A "micro" version of DFCI's multiplierz package. Only pure-python code, adding back dependencies only if absolutely necessary...
The namespace changes from e.g. multiplierz.mzAPI to mz.API...

Preferred Environment: Anaconda Python (http://continuum.io/downloads)
You will also need comtypes (currently not provided with Anaconda, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/comtypes)
