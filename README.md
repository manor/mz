mz
==

A "micro" version of DFCI's multiplierz package. Only pure-python code, adding back dependencies only if absolutely necessary...
The namespace changes from e.g. multiplierz.mzAPI to mz.API...

Preferred Environment: [Anaconda Python](http://continuum.io/downloads)

Once you have Anaconda Python running, simply type:

```
pip install mz
```

Make sure you have installed the [MSFileReader](http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703) from Thermo (this is necessary even if XCalibur is already installed on your computer)...
