mz
==

A "micro" version of DFCI's multiplierz package. Only pure-python code, adding back dependencies only if absolutely necessary...
The namespace changes from e.g. multiplierz.mzAPI to mz.API...

Preferred Environment: [Anaconda Python](http://continuum.io/downloads)

Once you have Anaconda Python running, simply type:

```
pip install mz
```

Make sure you have installed the [MSFileReader](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com) from Thermo (this is necessary even if XCalibur is already installed on your computer)... You will need to register and then login: look for it under "Utility Software", which is visible once you click "Thermo Fisher Scientific" in the "My Products" column of the "Download Central Home" page...
